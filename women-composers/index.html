    <h3 id="joinus">Supporting women composers</h3>

    <p>We have historically played some music by women composers, and the positive feedback from our Votes for Women centenary concert in 2018 encouraged us to decide on a policy of playing one piece by a woman composer in every concert for our 2019/20 season. We continued with this policy for our 2022 season and we remain committed to promoting women composers wherever we can.</p>
