    <h3 id="joinus">Supporting women composers</h3>

    <p>We have historically played some music by women composers, and the positive feedback from our Votes for Women centenary concert in 2018 encouraged us to decide on a policy of playing one piece by a woman composer in every concert for our 2019/20 season. We are continuing with this policy for our 2022 season.</p>
    <p>We are grateful for the continuing support of the <a href='http://www.ambachecharitabletrust.org/'>Ambache Charitable Trust</a>, which is active in raising the profile of women composers.</p>
